Below are specific guidelines for contributing to the Metadata Management Tool.
For general tips on open source contributions, see
[Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

# General Contribution Guidelines #

## Be Consistent ##

Please ensure that source code, file structure, and visual design do not break
existing conventions without compelling reasons.

This includes:

* [Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide)
* [Coffee script](https://github.com/polarmobile/coffeescript-style-guide)

## Test, and Don't Break Tests ##

Add tests for new work to ensure changes work and that future changes
do not break them. Run the test suite to ensure that new changes have
not broken existing features. Ensure that tests pass regardless
of timing or execution order.

MMT uses PhantomJS which allows us to run our Capybara tests on a headless
WebKit browser. Before you're able to run tests locally you'll need to install
it. The easiest way to accomplish this would be to use Homebrew or a similar
packager manager. See [README.md](README.md) for details on how to install.

# Code structure

Our code generally follows Ruby on Rails conventions. The descriptions below
describe useful conventions not outlined by Rails; they touch on the most
important pieces of code and do not attempt to describe every directory.

  * `app`
    * `policies` - See Pundit Gem
    * `services` - "ogre_client" for dealing with shapefile to get GEOJSON data
  * `cmr/` - CMR runtime for running locally
  * `lib/`
    * `cmr` - client for dealing with the CMR client
    * `echo` - client dealing with the ECHO client
    * `json_schema_form`
    * `test_cmr`

# Testing #

Fast and consistent tests are critical. The full suite is quite long and take at
least 45 minutes. Please ensure new tests run quickly and pass consistently
regardless of execution order so as to not extend the total time any longer then
necessary. Any suggestions for improving the total testing execution time is
welcome.

The entire suite of MMT tests, including unit, functional, and integration
tests, may be run using the `rspec` command.

# Pull requests #
Please describe your feature and changes in detail. If available, contact a
member of the team and arrange for a code review based on a newly created pull
request. Pull requests can not be accepted if tests do not pass. Further, we do
Continuous Integration tests which also must pass before any pull request can be
accepted.
