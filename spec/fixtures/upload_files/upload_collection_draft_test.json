  "Abstract": "The GRIP Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD) dataset was collected by the HIRAD instrument, which is a hurricane imaging, single-polarization passive C-band radiometer with both cross-track and along-track resolution that measures strong ocean surface winds through heavy rain from an aircraft or space-based platform. Its swath width is approximately 60 degrees in either direction. V0 data contains brightness temperature measurements taken at a 5 GHz frequency. Rain rate and wind speed files for Hurricane Earl have been added to the collection. HIRAD data was collected for storms Earl and Karl during the Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP) experiment from September 1, 2010 through September 16, 2010. The major goal was to better understandhow tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes. NASA used the DC-8 aircraft, the WB-57 aircraft and the Global Hawk Unmanned AirborneSystem (UAS), configuredwith a suite of in situ and remote sensing instruments that were used to observe and characterize the lifecycle of hurricanes.",
