        <p>The MMT for non-NASA users is a web-based user interface that allows metadata authors to create metadata draft proposals by using a data entry form based on the metadata fields in the Unified Metadata Model (UMM). Prior to being published to the NASA EOSDIS Common Metadata Repository (CMR), metadata draft proposals must be approved by NASA CMR personnel. Metadata authors may also submit requests to update existing CMR metadata records using the MMT.</p>
